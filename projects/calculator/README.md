Smart Python Calculator

This project is my first Python program — a command-line calculator I built to practice programming fundamentals and algorithmic thinking.

Features
- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /
- Decimal support
- Simple CLI interface with input handling and error messages

How to run
1. Install Python 3 if needed.
2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```
python smart_calculator.py
```

Notes for reviewers
- Source code: `projects/calculator/smart_calculator.py`
- I wrote this code myself as a learning project. I can convert it to a full web app or provide unit tests on request.
